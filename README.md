A C++ wrapper for the Tensorflow C API

This will allow you to take a network trained in python and run it in a c++ program. This wraps the Tensorflow C API in a class (which is supposedly more stable?).

To use this, there are two steps: ...
1) Build a shared tensorflow library ...
2) Build static wrapper library that links to shared tensorflow library

To build tensorflow shared library: ...
1) clone tensorflow: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow ...
2) checkout the version you want ...
3) cd into tensorflow/ root directory ...
4) run "./configure" ...
5) run "bazel build tensorflow:libtensorflow.so"

To build static wrapper library: ...
1) cd into tensorflow_cpp_wrapper/ root folder ...
2) set the "tensorflow_path" variable in the CMakeLists.txt to point to the root directory of tensorflow ...
2) mkdir build ...
3) cd build ...
4) cmake.. ...
5) make
